            <h1> Where It All Started </h1>
            <p>
                I was born on June 6th, 2000. Growing up on Long Island, NY, I was the only one in my family to be born in the states! My mother is from 
                Colombia, and my father is from Ecuador. I also have a brother who is eight years old than me, and has taught me the ways of the mighty
                PlayStation 1 and 2; this would mark the beginning of my love for technology. <br><br>

                At a young age, my father would introduce me to a well known movie called The Matrix. For those who don't know, The Matrix takes place in a 
                world where machines run everything. These machines, along with the humans operating them, created a simulation of the real world known as 
                The Matrix. Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, is extracted from The Matrix by Morpheus, played by Lawrence Fishburne, because he believes he is 
                The One; a being with special capabilities to destroy the machines once and for all! <br><br>

                It was the culmination of video games, The Matrix, and one of my older brothers introducing me to the coding world that gave me
                the heart and passion to pursue the life of a software developer!
            </p>

            <h1> Music Taste </h1>
            <p>
                Kanye West and Kid Cudi will always hold a special place in my heart. <br><br>
                While it may seem like Kanye goes crazy on social media, his past-work truly is an inspiration...if you just focus on you, you can 
                make it anywhere. If you haven't done so, I highly recommend watching his documentary on Netflix called "jeen-yuhs"<br><br>
                Kid Cudi is similar in that he too has gone through his own hardships with not only the outside world, but himself as well. 
                He was the first to popularize mental health in rap. Artists like Juice WRLD (RIP), and Travis Scott were all influenced by him and 
                his ability to be open about depression, and understanding that it's okay to not be okay.<br>
                <br>
                The music I got into later on in life is actually quite diverse. From Queen to Bad Bunny, from Led Zeppelin to The Weeknd, I
                have become one of the many who can say they "listen to everything".
