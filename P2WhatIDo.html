            <h1> What Keeps Me Busy </h1>
            <p>
                I start my days by going to the gym. In order to have a strong mental, you must keep up with your physical. I go Monday to Friday,
                hitting chest, legs, arms, shoulders, and back on each respective day of the week. Incorporating ab and cardio workout at the gym
                are a must for me, as I'm trying to cut weight. Eating is just as important as the exercise, so I make sure not to eat too much
                in one sitting, and spread my meals throughout the day. 
                <br><br>
                As of creating this website, my full-time job is training at Revature. I'm learning how to use my previous coding knowledge from
                Virginia Tech with the new material being learned in training to become a .NET Full Stack Software Developer! Revature truly is
                a unique opportunity I've landed, and I'm going to mke the most of it with my time here.

                Once the work day is over, I give myself a break from the desk. After my break, it's time to stream! I currently stream
                Call of Duty Warzone on Twitch to a lovely community I'm building. Streaming has been a hobby I've always wanted to try,
                but never had the chance to because of time constraints. Now I stream from Monday to Friday under the name Ksvviss!
                <br><br>
                Family is very important to me, and I do what I can to spend as much time with them as possible. The weekends are when I try to
                be with them the most. If I'm not with them, I'm most likely working my part time job at a local country club to make some extra
                cash. Money makes the world go 'round, but that won't stop me from being with the people who love me the most!
