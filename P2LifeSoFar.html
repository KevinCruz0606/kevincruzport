    <h1> Where it All Started </h1>
    <p style="width: 300px;"> 
        I was born on June 6th, 2000. Growing up on Long Island, NY, I was the only in my family to be born in the states! My mother is from 
        Colombia, and my father is from Ecuador. I also have a brother who is 8 years old than me, and has taught me the ways of the mighty
        PlayStation 1 and 2. This would mark the beginning of my love for technology. <br><br>

        At a young age, my father would introduce me to a well known movie called The Matrix. For those who don't know, The Matrix stars
        Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne, and other, and takes place in a world where machines run everything. These machines, along with the
        humans operating them, created a simulation of the real world known as The Matrix. Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, is extracted from The
        Matrix by Morpheus, played by Lawrence Fishburne, because he believes he is The One, a being with special capabilities to destroy the
        machines once and for all! <br><br>

        It was the culmination of video games, The Matrix, and one of my other older brothers introducing me to the coding world that gave me
        the true heart and passion to pursue the life of a software developer!
