            <h1> College </h1>
            <p>
                After High School, I was accepted into Virginia Tech with the intention of going head first into the College of Engineering
                and studying Computer Science. Plans changed, and I found an opportunity to pivot into the College of Science to
                then study Computational Modeling and Data Analytics with a minor in Computer Science! <br><br>
                In that time, I became the Webmaster for a Latinx organization called Latin Link, where I created a website for
                the organization using Google Sites! Not only that, I, along with a group of close friends revived the Latino Fraternity 
                known as La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda, Fraternity Inc. We publicized our leadership through academics,
                culture, brotherhood and service.<br><br>
                College taught me a lot. Not only was it about the classes and academic knowledge, but the major life-lessons that I reflect upon
                every day. College prepared me for the real world, and it prepared me to dive into the pursuits that I truly love!
