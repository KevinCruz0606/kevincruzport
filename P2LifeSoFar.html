            <h1> College </h1>
            <p>
                After High School, I was accepted into Virginia Tech, with the intention of going head first into the College of Engineering
                and studying Computer Science. Unfortunately, it didn't go as planned. That's when I switched into the College of Science to
                then study Computational Modeling and Data Analytics with a minor in Computer Science! <br><br>
                In that time, I became the Webmaster for a Latinx organization called Latin Link, where I was able to create a website for
                them using Google Sites! Not only that, I, along with a group of close friends, was able to revive the Latino Fraternity 
                known as La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda, Fraternity Inc. on campus and publicize our leadership through academics,
                culture, brotherhood and service.<br><br>
                College taught me a lot. Not only was it about the classes and academic knowledge, but the major life lesson that I reflect on
                every day. College prepared me for the real world, and it prepared me to pursue the things i truly love in life!
